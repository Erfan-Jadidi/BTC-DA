proj1 is about data analysis with yahoo finance bitcoin data and I wrote a code based on this question:
what would happened if I start from 2019/1/1 to buy bitcoin every Saturday in the open and sell it on Thursday on that week in close and do this until 2024/8/5 with 100$ in my wallet? show the plot of this, and what would happened if instead of sell in close I could sell in the high(it is clear that in the ideal way I would be very rich..)

proj1-2 is same like proj1 but it is on the web page and client can enter the start and end date of this process and by clicking the show button he/she can see the plot.

Tnx for reading :)
